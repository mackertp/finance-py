    "## Case Question Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "* to probe your intellectual curiosity\n",
    "* to test your analytical ability\n",
    "* to test your ability to think logically and organize your answer\n",
    "* to observe your thought process\n",
    "* to probe your tolerance for ambiguity and data overload\n",

    "* to see if you’re genuinely intrigued by problem-solving\n",
    "* to determine if consulting is a good “fit” for you\n",
    "\n",
    "### Commandments\n",
    "\n",
    "**[ 1. Listen to the Question ]**\n",
    "Listening is the most important skill a consultant has. The case isn’t about you or the consultant; it’s about the client. What are they really asking for?Pay particular attention to the last sentence — one word can change the entire case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[ 2. Take Notes ]**\n",
    "Taking notes during the case interview allows you to check back with the facts of the case. As someone once said, “The palest ink is stronger than\n",
    "the best memory.” If you blank out, all the information is right in front of you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[ 3. Summarize the Question ]**\n",
    "After you are given the question, take a moment to summarize the highlights out loud:\n",
    "It shows the interviewer that you listened.\n",
    "It allows you to hear the information a second time.\n",
    "It keeps you from answering the wrong question.\n",
    "It fills that otherwise awkward pause when you’re trying to think of something intelligent to say\n",
    "\n",
    "**[ 4. Verify the Objectives ]**\n",
    "Professional consultants always ask their clients to verify their objectives. Even if the objective seems obvious, there could be an additional,\n",
    "underlying objective. When the objective seems apparent, phrase the question differently: “One objective is to increase sales. Are there any other\n",
    "objectives I should know about?\n",
    "\n",
    "**[ 5. Ask Clarifying Questions ]**\n",
    "You ask questions for three main reasons:\n",
    "to get additional information that will help you identify and label the question\n",
    "to demonstrate to the interviewer that you are not shy about asking probing questions under difficult circumstances (something you’ll be doingon a regular basis as a consultant)\n",
    "to turn the question into a conversation (nothing turns off an interviewer more quickly than a five-minute monologue)\n",
    "In the beginning of the case, you have more latitude in your questioning. You should ask basic questions about the company, the industry, the\n",
    "competition, external market factors and the product. The further you get into the case, the more your questions should switch from open-endedquestions to closed-ended questions. You start to get into trouble when you ask broad, sweeping questions that are hard for the interviewer to\n",
    "answer. These kinds of questions give the impression that you’re trying to get the interviewer to answer the case for you. You’ll know that you\n",
    "crossed that line when the interviewer says to you, “What do you think?” When this happens, substitute assumptions for questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[ 6. Organize Your Answer ]**\n",
    "Identify and label your case, then lay out your structure. This is the hardest part of a case, and the most crucial. It drives your case and is often themajor reason behind whether you get called back. We will spend more time on this in Chapter Four.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[ 7. Hold That Thought for “One Alligator” ]**\n",
    "The interviewer wants you to think out loud, but also to think before you speak. If you make a statement that is way off base in an interview, the\n",
    "recruiter will wonder if he can trust you in front of a client. If he thinks he can’t trust you, the interview is over.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[ 8. Manage Your Time ]**\n",
    "Your answer should be as linear as possible. Don’t get bogged down in the details. Answer from a macro level and move the answer forward. It’s\n",
    "easy to lose your way by going off on a tangent. Stay focused on the original question asked. Finally, don’t lose track of the question, the objective\n",
    "or the framework. Go back to the original question and objectives during the case to make sure you haven’t lost your way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[ 9. Work the Numbers ]**\n",
    "If possible, try to work numbers into the problem. Demonstrate that you think quantitatively and that you are comfortable with numbers. When doingcalculations, explain what you are thinking and how you are going to do it. Take your time. I’d rather have you get it right than rush and make a\n",
    "careless mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[ 10. Be Coachable ]**\n",
    "Listen to the interviewer’s feedback. Is she trying to guide you back on track? Pay attention to her body language. Are you boring her? Is she about\n",
    "to nod off? Is she enthralled?\n",
    "Being coachable also means asking for help when you need it. If you run into a wall, lose your train of thought or are just in over your head, ask for\n",
    "help. There is no shame in asking for help; it’s a sign of maturity. Look at it from the interviewer’s point of view. If you were working on an actual\n",
    "project and got stuck, she would much rather that you ask for help than waste time spinning your wheels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[ 11. Be Creative and Brainstorm]**\n",
    "Some of the best experiences you’ll have as a consultant will be brainstorming over Chinese food at 10 o’clock at night. Brainstorming without\n",
    "commitment, as consultants call it, allows you to toss out uninhibited suggestions without being married to them. It gives you the opportunity toreview all the options and eliminate the inappropriate ones. Consulting firms like liberal arts candidates with intellectual curiosity who can “thinkoutside the box” and offer up a new and interesting perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[ 12. Exude Enthusiasm and a Positive Attitude ]**\n",
    "Earlier we spoke about a “rip right through it” attitude. It’s not enough to do well on the case; you have to thrive on the challenge of the case.\n",
    "Recruiters want people who are excited by problem-solving and can carry that enthusiasm throughout the entire interview.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[ 13. Bring Closure and Summarize ]**\n",
    "If you have done all of the above and you’ve made it through the analysis, the final action is to create a sense of closure by summarizing the case.\n",
    "Review your findings, restate your suggestions and make a recommendation. You don’t need to sum up the whole answer; pick two or three keypoints and touch on those. Students are often afraid to make a recommendation, thinking that their analysis was faulty, so therefore their answers\n",
    "will be wrong. There are no wrong answers. Just make sure your answer makes good business sense and common sense."

    "I’m going to estimate that 50 percent of the households are either suburban or rural. That makes 50 million households. I’ll also assume that 20% of those homes are apartments or condos. That narrows us down to 40 million houses that most likely use a garden hose. \n",
    "\n",
    "Garden hoses are relatively inexpensive, so people are likely to have a hose in the front and a hose in the backyard. That makes 80 million hoses. I want to add in another 10 million hoses, which can be found in nurseries, zoos, and other outdoor facilities. Most of those businesses have at least two hoses. We are now up to 90 million garden hoses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hoses aren’t replaced every year. I’d say that they are replaced every 3 years unless they are run over by a lawn mower or run into the business end of a dog’s tooth. So we take 90 million hoses, divide that number by 3 and come up with 30 million garden hoses sold each year."

I’m going to assume that the population of the US is 320 million, that the life expectancy is 80 years, and that there are the same number of people in each age group (i.e., there is the exact same number of 3-year-olds as 73-year-olds).
